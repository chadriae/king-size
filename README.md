# Chained :bike:

## The idea :bulb:

Your bike is broken again, your tire is flat and you don't have the time nor the equipment to repair it. And you don't like walking your broken bike to the nearest bike repair shop, where you have to wait a couple of days to get your bike fixed.

Now you can look for a bike repairer in your neighborhood! Filter the repairers to your needs and get in contact. You can arrange a meeting at your home and you can get your bike fixed in no time!

On the other hand, if you are a bike repairer yourself you can register and make an account and add information about yourself. Set your specialties and categories of bikes, and find your next job in the neighborhood.

## Working out the project :question:

There are two important parts to the project: the part where as a user you look for a repairer in your neighborhood and the other where you can register as a repairer.

We split up the back-end part in a Laravel app and the front-end part is purely Vue. The data from the back-end is sent via an api to the front-end where the data is processed.

A list of features we wanted to include:

-   working register, login/logout system in Laravel (Breeze)
-   repairers can add/edit data about themselves
-   use Google maps data to write to the DB and reuse them in de front-end
-   use Vue as a front-end framework
-   filter repairers by specialties, categories and location
-   use a Google map to look for repairers in the neighborhood
-   ...
