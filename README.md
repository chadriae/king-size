# Chained :bike:

## The idea :bulb:

> "Oh no, my bike broke again! I don't know how to fix my tire and I don't feel like bringing my bike to the bike repair shop..."

Now you can look for a bike repairer in your neighborhood! Filter the repairers to your needs and get in contact. You can arrange a meeting at your home and you can get your bike fixed in no time!

On the other hand, if you are a bike repairer yourself you can register and make an account and add information about yourself. Set your specialties and categories of bikes, and find your next job in the neighborhood.

## Working out the project :question:

There are two important parts to the project: the part where as a user you look for a repairer in your neighborhood and the other where you can register as a repairer.

We split up the back-end part in a Laravel app and the front-end part is purely Vue. The data from the back-end is sent via an api to the front-end where the data is processed.

A list of features we wanted to include:

-   working register, login/logout system in Laravel (Breeze)
-   repairers can add/edit data about themselves
-   use Google maps data to write to the DB and reuse them in de front-end
-   use Vue as a front-end framework
-   filter repairers by specialties, categories and location
-   use a Google map to look for repairers in the neighborhood
-   ...
